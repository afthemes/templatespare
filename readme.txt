== Description ==
A beautiful collection of Ready to Import Starter Sites with just one click. Get modern & creative websites in minutes!

== Installation ==

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New',
2. Search for 'Templatespare' and install the plugin.
3. Activate 'Templatespare' from your Plugins page.

Once the plugin is activated you will find the actual import menu **Templatespare.** on your WordPress admin dashboard

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated the plugin. Where is the "Templatespare" page? =

You will find the import page in *wp-admin -> Templatespare*.

= Where are the demo import files and the log files saved? =

The files used in the demo import will be saved to the default WordPress uploads directory. An example of that directory would be: `../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/`.

The log file will also be registered in the *wp-admin -> Media* section, so you can access it easily.

= I can't activate the plugin, because of a fatal error, what can I do? =

*Update: There is now a admin error notice, stating that the minimal PHP version required for this plugin is 5.3.2.*

You want to activate the plugin, but this error shows up:

*Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error*

This happens, because your hosting server is using a very old version of PHP. This plugin requires PHP version of at least **5.3.x**, but we recommend version *5.6.x*. Please contact your hosting company and ask them to update the PHP version for your site.
